# Classes Exercise: Writing a Method

Please edit `main.py`, and do the following:

* Run the program and see what it does.
* Add a new method called `print_contents` that reads the contents of the file, and uses print to show the results.
* At the bottom of the file, have the `test_file` call the new `print_contents` method.
* Try running the program, and confirm that there are no errors that show up.

(Hint: there is information about reading from files [here](https://programming-1.vercel.app/lessons/files/basic_file_operations.html).)
